## GraphQL API

We don't make any guarantee on the stability of the GraphQL API provided by the proxy. We often do breaking changes between versions.

On each release, we publish the schema under `schemal.graphql` so you should be able to diff it easily. It is usually self explanatory but do feel free to contact us on [Discord](https://links.cyware.khulnasoft.com/www-discord) if you have questions.

You can always access a GraphQL playground by going to `http://[INSTANCE_IP]:[INSTANCE_PORT]/graphql`.
